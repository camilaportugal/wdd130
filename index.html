            <p>Hello my name is Camila Estefania Portugal Pickling, I'm from Iquitos-Peru, I'm 18 years old, I like to play 
                the guitar, listen music, watchg k-dramas and dance. I'm studying programming with functions and web 
                development. I want to go on a mission next year. I have 2 older sisters and I'm the youngest, I have been 
                living in my city Iquitos for 12 years and 5 months ago I visited United State for 3 months. My favorite colors 
                are green and pink and my favorite food is "Pollo a la Brasa". I have two cats and a dog, my dog is named Thobby 
                and is 8 years old, the first cat is 3 years old and her name is Laly, and my second cat is 2 years old and her 
                name is Scarly. I was in the Pathway program for a year, and now I'm studying at BYU (software development) to get 
                a  degree, lamentably in my city there is just one university, and education is poor, that's why I chose BYU, 
                because I want to have a better education, I want to be able to become someone with a degree, and a job. I have a 
                calling in the Church, I'm the secretary of the Young Women presidency, I enjoy working with young women, they 
                always have creative ideas, and they're really funny girls. </p>
