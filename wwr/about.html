                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>In the depths of a valley, surrounded by beautiful mountains, where rivers roar with uncontrollable force, 
                    lies RAFTURA, a rafting company founded by individuals passionate about nature and the spirit of adventure. 
                    Our company's motto, "Sail the Adventure, Conquer the Wild," is not just a phrase; it's the guiding principle of 
                    our expeditions whose history is intertwined with that of the river that feeds it, the Storm River. This river, 
                    with its crystal-clear waters cascading from the mountain heights, is both the muse and the challenge for rafting 
                    experts. Every trip with Raftura is an opportunity to embrace the wild beauty of the natural world while facing 
                    the controlled fury of the waters.

                    encounters with wildlife to moments of camaraderie around the campfire at night, each day on the river leaves an 
                    indelible mark on the hearts of those who venture with Raftura. With over two decades of experience in the world 
                    of rafting, Raftura has forged its reputation as an undisputed leader in the industry. Over the years, they have
